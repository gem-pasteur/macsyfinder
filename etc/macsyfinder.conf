[system]
;the maximum distance between 2 genes is defined

;to specify several system put the system and the value on the same line 
;as bellow

;the minimum of mandatory genes required to have a system is defined
;in the definitions files but can be override here

[general]
;the verbosity of the output can be set with 
; a keyword or an integer
; not set or  0
; debug   or 10

; critical or 50
; log_level = debug

;the maximum number of worker
;macsyfinder can parallelized the hmm search step using multi threading
;by default a worker is created by gene to search (worker_nb = 0)
;you can limit the number of worker with this option
;worker_nb = 0
