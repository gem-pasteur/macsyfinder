MacSyFinder relies on the definition of models of macromolecular systems as a **set of models' components** 
to be searched by similarity search, and a **set of rules** regarding their genomic organization and 
their requirement level to make a complete system (mandatory, accessory components, number of components required). 

See the section :ref:`model-definition-grammar-label` for more details on MacSyFinder's modelling scheme and the section 
on :ref:`Functioning <functioning>` for the principles of the MacSyFinder's search engine.


A **MacSyFinder model** (macsy-model for short) is the association of several elements:

    * a **definition** which describes the system to detect with a specific **XML grammar** that is :ref:`described here<model-definition-grammar-label>`.
    
    * a set of :ref:`HMM profiles <provide-hmm_label>`  (one per component/gene in the model) to enable the similarity search of the systems' components with the HMMER program.

The models are grouped by *family* possibly gathering *sub-families* (multiple levels allowed), for instance *Secretion*, *Cas-proteins*...
A set of models from a same family (coherent set) of systems to detect is called hereafter a **macsy-model package** ``NEW in V2``.



.. _package_structure:


Structure of a macsy-model package
==================================

A macsy-model package follows the following structure: ::

    family_name
        |_______ metadata.yml
        |_______ LICENSE
        |_______ README.md
        |_______ model_conf.xml
        |_______ definitions
        |            |________ model_1.xml
        |            |________ model_2.xml
        |            :
        |
        |_______ profiles
                     |________ geneA.hmm
                     |________ geneB.hmm
                     |________ geneC.hmm.gz


If the package contains sub-families: ::

    family_name
        |_______ metadata.yml
        |_______ LICENSE
        |_______ README.md
        |_______ model_conf.xml

        |            |________ subfamilyA
        |            |            |________ model_1.xml
        |            |            |________ model_2.xml
        |            |
        |            |________ subfamilyB
        |            |            |________ model_3.xml
        |            |            |________ model_4.xml
        |            |
        |            :
        |
        |_______ profiles
                     |________ geneA.hmm
                     |________ geneB.hmm
                     |________ geneC.hmm.gz


For examples of macsy-model packages, please visit https://github.com/macsy-models

You can create a template for your package by using `macsydata init`.
It will create for you:

* the data package directory with the right structure.
* a template of `metadata.yaml` .
* a template of `README.md` file.
* a generic `model_conf.xml` file.
* a LICENSE file if `--license` option is set.
* a COPYRIGHT file if `--holders` option is set.
* a directory `definitions` with an example of model definition (model_example.xml to remove before publishing).
* a directory `profiles` where to put the hmm profiles corresponding to the models genes.

.. note::

    MSF can also read *.gz* compressed files; it will uncompress them on the fly.
    The compressed files must end with the *.gz* extension.
    For the `hmmsearch` step You need to have `gunzip` installed on your system for this to work.


README.md
---------

A description of the package: what kind of systems the package models,
how to use it etc... in `markdown <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`_ format.
The Readme is displayed to the user on the macsy-models repository on Github.
It is also displayed when the user runs `macsydata help`.


LICENSE
-------

The license is used to protect your work when sharing it.
If you don't know which license to choose, have a look at `CreativeCommons <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/>`_
*This file is optional, but highly recommended.*


Metadata file
-------------

The `metadata.yml` file contains some meta information about the package itself.

It is in `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format and must have the following structure:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    maintainer:
      name: The name of the person who maintains/to contact for further information. (required)
      email: The email of the maintainer (required)
    short_desc: A one line description of the package (can e.g. be used for *macsydata* searches) (required)
    vers: The package version (required)
    cite: The publication(s) to cite by the user when the package is used (optional, used by `macsydata cite`)
    doc: Where to find extended documentation (optional)
    license: The license under the package is released (optional but highly recommended)
    copyright: The copyright of the package (optional)

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    maintainer:
       name: first name last name
       email: login@my_domain.com
    short_desc: Models for 15 types of secretion systems or bacterial appendages (T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T4P, pT4SSt, pT4SSi, T5aSS, T5bSS, T5bSS, T6SSi, T6SSii, T6SSiii, Flagellum, Tad, T9SS).

.. warning::
    This `metadata.yml` file is **mandatory**. Without this file your archive/repository will not be considered as a *macsy-model package*.

.. note::

    * *-* specify an item of yaml list
    * *|* is used to specify a single item but over multiple lines.



.. _model_configuration:

Model configuration
-------------------

The modeler has the possibility to specify some options that are specific to their package, 
different than the MacSyFinder defaults in the `model_conf.xml` file. ``NEW in v2`` 

These options can be grouped in two families: the scoring weights and filtering options.

Scoring weights:

    * mandatory (*float* default = 1.0)
    * accessory (*float* default = 0.5)
    * exchangeable (*float* default = 0.8)
    * loner_multi_systems (*float* default =  0.7)
    * redundancy_penalty (*float* default = 1.5)

Filtering options:

    * e_value_search (*float* default = 0.1)
    * i_evalue_sel (*float* default = 0.001)
    * profile_coverage (*float* default = 0.5)
    * cut_ga (*bool* default = True)

All these options are optional and can be omitted in the configuration file, **the file itself is optional**.
The precedence rules between the different levels of configuration are:


.. code-block:: text

 system < home < model < project < --cfg-file | --previous-run < command line options

* **system**: the `macsyfinder.conf` file either in /etc/macsyfinder/ or in ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/etc/macsyfinder/
  in case of a *virtualenv* this configuration affects only the MacSyFinder version installed in this virtualenv
* **home**:  the `~/.macsyfinder/macsyfinder.conf` file
* **model**: the `model_conf.xml` file at the root of the model package
* **project**: the `macsyfinder.conf` file found in the directory where the `macsyfinder` command was run
* **cfgfile**: any configuration file specified by the user on the command line (conflicts with the `--previous-run` option)
* **previous-run**: the `macsyfinder.conf` file found in the results directory of the previous run (conflicts with the `--cfg-file` option)
* **command line**: any option specified directly in the command line

The model_conf.xml configuration file is in xml format and must have the following structure: 

.. code-block:: xml

    <model_config>
        <weights>
            <mandatory>1</mandatory>
            <accessory>0.5</accessory>
            <exchangeable>0.8</exchangeable>
            <redundancy_penalty>1.5</redundancy_penalty>
            <out_of_cluster>0.7</out_of_cluster>
        </weights>
        <filtering>
            <e_value_search>0.1</e_value_search>
            <i_evalue_sel>0.01</i_evalue_sel>
            <coverage_profile>0.5</coverage_profile>
            <cut_ga>True</cut_ga>
        </filtering>
    </model_config>
