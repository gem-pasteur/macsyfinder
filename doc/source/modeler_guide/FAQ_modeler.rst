How to report an issue?
-----------------------

If you encounter a problem while running MacSyFinder, please submit an issue on the dedicated page of the `GitHub project <https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder/issues>`_

To ensure we have all elements to help, please provide: 

- a concise description of the issue
- the expected behavior VS observed one
- the exact command-line used 
- the version of MacSyFinder used
- the exact error message, and if applicable, the `macsyfinder.log` and `macsyfinder.conf` files
- if applicable, an archive (or link to it) with the output files obtained
- if possible, the smallest dataset there is to reproduce the issue
- if applicable, this would also include the macsy-models (XML models plus HMM profiles) used (or precise version of the models if there are publicly available). Same as above, if possible, please provide the smallest set possible of models and HMM profiles. 

All these will definitely help us to help you! ;-)
