Getting started with a (not-so-)simple example: modelling the T1SS
------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Identifying genetic components

The type I secretion system consists in three components: 

- an ABC transporter (ABC)
- a membrane-fusion protein (MFP)
- an outer membrane protein (OMF)

For their detection, we therefore need to provide HMM profiles for each component. 

2. Determining the role of the components


3. Describing their genetic architecture
The genes encoding these proteins
